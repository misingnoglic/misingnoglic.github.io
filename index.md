Hello, welcome to my website! I CAN afford a home in the Bay Area, but I can afford a home page ;)

[Click here](https://goo.gl/forms/jzaFhUpZ6x17oOJh2) to sign up for email updates.

Click the navigation links above to see what the site has to offer. I suggest [About](/about), [Blog](/blog), or [Resources](/resources).
