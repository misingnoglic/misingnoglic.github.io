Sorry for the low effort post, this was originally hidden but I have brought it back just so I can show others when they ask. 

One of my big accomplishments while on the YouTube Web Embedded Player team was a
full-stack complete redesign of the embedded player error screen redesign.

If you don't remember, this is what the error screen used to look like:

And here's what it looks like now!
