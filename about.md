Hey everyone, my name is Arya. I'm a software engineer currently working for Amazon based in Los Angeles. I am working with Amazon Studios to create software to inform decisions about when to release shows. If you're looking for a job, let me know :)

Previously I was a software engineer at Oscar Health. I was on the communications infrastructure team (internally known as the HyperChannel team), working with really awesome people to bring health insurance to the present, specifically in regards to communications software. I worked with my team to build and maintain full-stack services related to video chatting, designing and sending emails, designing and sending snail-mail, and configuring documents with complex logic. I am probably most proud of creating software that people today use to get $0 virtual primary care, but I am also proud of the dead-name alerts I created to alert teams when their emails were sending emails with members legal name instead of preferred name.

Previous to that, I was a software engineer @ Google, working on the YouTube Web Embedded Player (like the one below):

I'm from Los Angeles, born to two Iranian Jewish immigrants. My fascination with computers started at a young age, and I wanted to learn programming when I saw people making programs to play the game Runescape, but I actually started learning programming in 11th grade, when I took a math class with a teacher who taught the concepts using Python. This class started my fascination with programming, and I was immediately hooked, doing problems on CodingBat and Project Euler instead of the homework I was supposed to. I continued on to Brandeis University where I did a double major in computer science and music.

One of my huge interests is in computer science education - I believe that we are doing it completely wrong, and I'd love to use this blog as a means to create programming education, as well as discuss my thoughts on CS education in general. My non technical interests include music (classical and pop), Persian language, Iranian culture and politics, movies, US politics, social justice, and spending way too much time on esoteric Facebook groups.
