Hi everyone, my name is Arya. I'm a recent computer science/music graduate from Brandeis University, and currently work at Google as a software engineer, working on Youtube web embedded videos. I'm from Los Angeles, born to two Iranian Jewish immigrants. My fascination with computers started at a young age, but I started learning programming in 11th grade, when I took a math class with a teacher who taught the concepts using Python. This class started my fascination with programming, and I was immediately hooked, doing problems on CodingBat and Project Euler instead of the homework I was supposed to. 

After being inspired by this class, I decided to study computer science at Brandeis, a small liberal arts type university near Boston, MA. I really loved the ability to do cs at a smaller university, as it allowed me to establish relationships with professors, and do things that I wouldn't be able to do at a larger, more competitive school. For example, starting sophomore year, I was able to TA the Intro to CS course at Brandeis, establishing my love of teaching and helping develop my thoughts about CS education in general. I was also able to start the first hackathon at Brandeis, and study abroad at the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore, India (probably my hardest semester). I did a double major with music as well, as I was a huge music nerd (being in band since the 6th grade), and Brandeis was the kind of nerdy school that encouraged completely unnecessary double majors. 

I just started at Google, so I don't have much to say about that yet (except the impostor syndrome struggle bus is real). My technical interests include everything Python (I'm a huge fanboy), Computer Science education (which is a real s**t show in the USA), web development, cryptography, and technical interviews/recruitment. My goal with this website is to improve my communication skills, as well as have an outlet to talk about my thoughts besides my girlfriend (who probably has to proofread everything you see here). My end goal is to write a Python book for beginners that is universally accessable and understandable by all age groups and demographics, to be used in schools and for people independentally curious about learning programming. And yes, it will be in Python!

My non technical interests include music (classical and pop), Persian language, Iranian culture and politics, movies, US politics, social justice, and spending way too much time on esoteric Facebook groups.
